// Readme First:

// ICT Fair Value Gap (FVG) Scanner

// Logic
//   - A fully filled Fair Value Gap (FVG) is more likely to bounce back with strong momentum.
//   - If the FVG is larger in height, the probability of a bounce back increases.
//   - In most live trading sessions by ICT, a large FVG is often filled slowly or with high resistance.
//   - This is similar to filling a Liquidity Void.

// Notes
//   - Use a higher timeframe, like 1 hour, for stock selection.
//   - The Scanner will generate wrong signals also.
