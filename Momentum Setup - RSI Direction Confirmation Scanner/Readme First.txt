// Readme First:

// Momentum Setup: RSI Direction Confirmation Scanner

// Long Signal Logic:
//   - RSI crosses above 60.
//   - Look for a red candle where RSI is still above 60.
//   - If a green candle crosses above the red candle and RSI is still above 60, a long signal is generated.
//   - If the signal candle is large, wait for a 50% or FVG retracement before entering; otherwise, enter after the signal with a predefined risk and quantity.
//   - Use additional personal confirmations as needed.

// Short Signal Logic:
//   - RSI crosses below 40.
//   - Look for a green candle where RSI is still below 40.
//   - If a red candle crosses below the green candle and RSI is still below 40, a short signal is generated.
//   - If the signal candle is large, wait for a 50% or FVG retracement before entering; otherwise, enter after the signal with a predefined risk and quantity.
//   - Use additional personal confirmations as needed.
